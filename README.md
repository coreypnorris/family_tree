# Family tree

This is a command-line app to track a family tree. It's an exercise in using Active Record without Rails, and playing around with associations that aren't always straightforward.

So far, the only functionality that's been implemented is tracking which people are married to each other.

Future features:

* Tracking children
* Reporting parents
* Reporting siblings, cousins, uncles/aunts, etc.
* Tracking divorces
--------------------
* DONE - Let users enter a person, and describe that person as the child of two people.
* DONE - Flesh out the user interface to show a list of people, and lets you choose one to see who they're married to and who their parents are.
* DONE - Show who somebody's grandparents and grandchildren are.
* Add support for siblings, cousins, uncles, aunts, etc.
* Finally, add support for divorces, which may be almost as difficult in the database as in real life.
